## Installation

```
npm install @vinorcola/dynamic-table
```

Then, if you use TailwindCSS, you must source the stylesheet file of the library within your file:

```css
/* Example of style.css */
@import "tailwindcss";
@source "../node_modules/@vinorcola/dynamic-table";
```

If you want to customize rendering, you can create a new file that re-export the dynamic table with new components:

```typescript
```
